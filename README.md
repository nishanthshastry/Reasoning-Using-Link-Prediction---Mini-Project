# Reasoning-Using-Link-Prediction---Mini-Project

The aim was to try and find a way to use the concept of "Link Prediction" to perform reasoning between a person(user) and an automated AI to respond in a meaningful manner.

**Programming Language** - Python 3

## Concepts Used - 

1. **TFIDF** - Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
2. **Cosine Similarity**

## Steps to execute the codes (and understand the working of the project with the concepts used) - 

1. Download the _*'.json'*_ files.
2. Run the _*'dataset_formation.py'*_ file.
3. You will observe the _*'final_dataset.csv'*_ file is created.
4. Run the _*'mini_project_final_code.py'*_ file.
5. You will observe that two _*'pickle'*_ files will be created - vectorizor and training matrix
6. In the command prompt or terminal you will observe the following,
   - The first 5 rows of the dataset.
   - The total rows of the dataset - Q/A count
   - The passed and failed test cases
   - Accuracy
